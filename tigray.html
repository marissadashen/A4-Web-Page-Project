                <p>Dinish/Potato Dish was spectacular! Leaves a tinted yellow stain on your nails, since you have to use your hands to eat with the Flat-Sour-Bread. It was Amazing! Recommend Genet’s Werki Tigray Restaurant to anyone craving a spicy, mouth watering, healthy meal! </p>

                <p>Hi, Mercy here. My mom makes me eat here, — she’s the restaurant owner. She says it’s healthy for you and says if I don’t eat here no one will. She’s making me write a review too, but I guess I want to, do I’m here. Let me tell you, Tihlo (Tigray’s traditional dish) is my FAVORITE and you should totally try it, especially with a group of at least five friends, if you don’t have five friends grab some folks you’ll meet at our restaurant and share. Trust me, you won’t be able to finish this dish on your own. By the way it’s very spicy, so make sure you dip the ‘Tihlo’ into the yogurt that’s in the middle of the meat and spices stew and you’ll love it! Go on, order my favorite: ‘Tihlo’ and get a taste of Tigray, our beautiful homeland — you will NOT be disappointed! </p>
                 
                <h4>#3: Kidu’ Love</h4>

                <p>Yo college students - want cheap, but healthy food? Genet’s WERKI TIGRAY restaurant is it! It’s simply ‘Golden’ just like its name (‘WERKI’ means ‘Golden’ in language: Tigrigna)  anyway, they have the most amazing food. I’m a college student, I can’t cook, I hate the kitchen, my mom’s too far to cook for me, so until I can afford to hire a cook — Werki Tigray restaurant is it. I love their spicy Ethiopian food and even my mom agrees how healthy it is when she visited me last, so this restaurant is literally my second home. I highly recommend it! </p>
