                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>6 eggs</li>
                    <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>1½ teaspoon vanilla</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon orange rind</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
                <p>Heat ½ cup sugar in a skillet, stirring constantly until it melts. It will turn a dark golden color. Remove from heat. Immediately pour the melted sugar into a round tart pan or round pie pan. Swirl it around the pan to evenly coat the bottom. In a large bowl, beat the eggs. To the bowl, add milk (or half and half), ½ cup sugar, vanilla, and orange peel. For the water bath: Place a large roasting pan on an oven rack. Inside the roasting pan, add the caramel coated pan to the center. Pour egg mixture into the caramel coated pan. Run the tap water until it gets hot. Carefully add the hot tap water in the roasting pan and around the uncooked flan pan to a depth of 1 inch. Bake at 325 F for close to l hour, or until a knife comes out clean. Cool the flan on a wire rack. Then chill for at least 3½ hours. To unmold the flan: Use a spatula and gently go around the sides of the pan. Place the serving platter over the pan. Flip the pan and the platter and allow the flan to come down. Spoon any of the caramel that may remain in the pan on top of the flan. Slice and Enjoy!</p>

                <p>El Picante Pachanga means spicy party.  The restaurant was started by brothers Edward and Richard, originally as a food truck.  Once popularity picked up they were able to expand to the 1 permanant restaurant here in the city, while also providing catering services from their original food truck.  If you like spicy food, and a good time this is the place to get your fill</p>

                <p>Excellent tacos, best I think I have had.  They also have the option of flower tortillas or corn if a soft taco is ordered.  Something I that is hard to find with other mexican restaurants in the area</p>

                <p>I was skeptical with the "interesting" name choice but I did not want to cook, so the family gathered in the van and decided to go out and eat somewhere new.  Friendly and festive atmosphere kept everyone happy, and kept the kids entertained while we waited for our food</p>

                <p>I am not much for spicy food, but it was not my turn to pick where the crew was going for lunch today.  Surprisingly, I found the non spicy options very tasty and the flan melts in your mouth</p>
