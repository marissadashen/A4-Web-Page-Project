    <h4>Review #1 from Hazel J.</h4>
    <h5>****</h5>
    <h5>3 days ago</h5>
     
    <p>My friend and I ate at this establishment the other day and I was very
    impressed. I ordered the hasenpfeffer which is a rabbit stew braised in a tangy sauce
    and my friend ordered the cheese dumplings with mushroom broth. I have no
    complaints about the food because it was exceptionally delicious. 
    Our only complaint is that this restaurant is located next to a farm, and we
    happened to be dining on the outdoor patio. We were surrounded by a flock of about
    10-12 chickens that would not stop pestering us for food. 
    Overall, the food was great, and I would eat here again, but I recommend dining
    indoors. I took one star off for the unruly chickens.</p>
     
    <h4>Review #2 from Dottie D.</h4>
    <h5>**</h5>
    <h5>2 months ago</h5>
     
    <p>I dined here this evening, and I have to say the customer service here is
    awful. I ordered rabbit stew with mashed potatoes and a large mug of ale to wash it
    down. The food arrived quickly, and the portion was enormous. The food was a bit
    bland and the ale was so watery, it had no flavor. The ale tasted like water that is
    pretending to be beer. Anyways, I finished eating and waited a very long time to receive
    my check. The grumpy server kept scowling at me from afar, perhaps because I had so
    much food leftover.</p>
     
    <h4>Review #3 from Klaus L.</h4>
    <h5>*</h5>

    <p>I regret getting takeout from here. The food was gross and overpriced for
    what I got. I ordered the hasenpfeffer stew and they left the bones in the meat. Very
    difficult to eat when on the go. Also the owner and the servers were rude. I would give 
    them negative stars if I could.</p>
     
    <h3>Response from the  owner</h3>
     
    <p>Hello Klaus, thank you for your review. We regret that you had a bad
    experience here at our restaurant, but leaving a bad review because you didn’t
    like the dish you ordered is not very nice. We hope your day gets better.
    </p>
